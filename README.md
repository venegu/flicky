# Project 1 - *Flicky*

**Flicky** is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [ ] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [ ] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [ ] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [ ] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User sees an error message when there's a networking error.
- [ ] Movies are displayed using a CollectionView instead of a TableView.
- [ ] User can search for a movie.
- [ ] All images fade in as they are loading.
- [ ] Customize the UI.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Tap top/bar area to scroll up the table view (similar to a back to top button on a website w/o the button)
- [ ] Animation for the movie poster (fading)
- [ ] Gradient background of gray => black
- [ ] Bottom bar with buttons for other views that display __Now Playing__, __Top Rated__, __Upcoming__, __Popular__, __Watch List__ movies
- [ ] Add a view (__Watch List__) where the user can add movies they would like to watch
- [ ] Animation when flipping between the different views mentioned previously
- [ ] Use long press in any view to add a movie to the __Watch List__
- [ ] Custom movie/theater related icons, buttons & launch screen
- [ ] Use [WebView](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31762450/ios-in-app-browser) to allow users to see more information about a movie in an online movie site and potentially purchase tickets
- [ ] Shake for a random movie suggestion? (This might be tricky since the movies aren't saved to the device!)
- [ ] [iPhone app tour](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13335540/how-to-make-first-launch-iphone-app-tour-guide-with-xcode) for the [first launch](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19376201/ios-first-launch-tour-detecting-if-the-app-is-launched-for-the-first-time)

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

## Learning Notes

### Tables

   - In order to make a table you will need to update view controller class to include `UITableViewDataSource` and `UITableViewDelegate` as follow:

   ``` swift
   class MoviesViewController: UIViewController, UITableViewDataSource, UITableViewDelegate {

   ```

   - In addition to the above, two functions must be added: `numberOfRowsInSection` and `cellForRowAtIndexPath`. You can find these functions by holding down Command and hovering over `UITableViewDataSource` and `UITableViewDelegate` in the function above.

   Below are examples of these functions from my code:

   ```swift
   func tableView(tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -> Int{
        return 20

    }

    func tableView(tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
        let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier("MovieCell", forIndexPath: indexPath)
        cell.textLabel?.text = "row: \(indexPath.row)"
        print("row \(indexPath.row)")
        return cell
    }

    ```

### APIs

   - An __API (Application Programming Interface)__ is any web server that can understand HTTP requests and expose resources to any program that can send an HTTP request, where resources are something like `movie/now_playing` (ex. JSON).

   - They generally provide examples of GET, POST, etc.

   - __REST (Representational State Transfer)__ is an architecture for designing networked aplications where simple HTTP requests are used to make calls between machines. Think: collections of things with properties ex. Facebook users (w/properties like name, hometown, relationship status, etc.) and their posts (w/properties like time posted, # of likes, comments, etc.)

   - RESTful applications use HTTP requests to post data (create/update), read data, and delete data. These operations that can occur to collections of "things" with properties are known as __CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete)__.
